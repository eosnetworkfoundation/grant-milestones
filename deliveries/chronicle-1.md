The first milestone was aiming to update the software and its
dependencies to the current state of Antelope software.

- external dependencies are now in sync with Leap 4.0.

- Boost 1.80.0 is currently used.

- a script is added for pinned builds, analogous to that in Leap

- pre-compiled chronicle packages are available for Ubuntu 20.04 and 22.04

- a few bugfixes added

- fixed the problem with async mode in "chronicle-consumer" NPM

- an archive of Chronicle data snapshots is available at https://snapshots.eosamsterdam.net/public/chronicle-2.x/



**Additional Information**

Milestone 2 (Research) has been skipped: the current Chainbase backend
is stable and performing well. Also, a lack of available time to run a
proper PoC.
